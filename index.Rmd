Hi Ladies and Gentlement,

I AM TINGWEI ADECK.


This is my personal site where I share a little bit about me and some things I am passionate about. The site will host some information about me and a lot about my data science journey.


CLICK on the [`HOME icon`](about.html) for a quick biography OR simply click the [`CV icon`](cv.html) if visiting the site on a professional capacity.

```{r}
first_program <- readline("Hello World")
second_program <- readline("Take a first step as seen above because my journey did not start with Hello World")
```
